\section{Wallet Criteria}

To assess the suitability of a wallet for integration within the protocol, the following criteria have been established:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	\item Custom Nonce and Gas Fee Configuration
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, nolistsep]
		\item Users should have the capability to set a custom nonce and gas fee directly from the wallet interface.
		\item Alternatively, the wallet should support the configuration of nonce and gas fees through a decentralized application (DApp).
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This criterion ensures the flexibility of the wallet in adjusting transaction parameters, providing users with direct control or enabling configuration through our protocol.

To identify wallets meeting these criteria, we compiled a list from various sources \cite{walletconnect_explorer_nodate}, evaluating their compatibility with our established criteria.

For the DApp, we implemented two versions: one utilizing WalletConnect and Ethers.js, and the other solely relying on Web3.js. This approach allows us to explore different integration methods and assess their respective advantages within the context of our criteria.


\section{Hot Wallets for Web Browser / Desktop}

\subsection{Metamask}
Usability: \textcolor{red}{Cannot be used}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, nolistsep]
	\item [\textcolor{red}{\xmark}] Custom Nonce
	\item [\textcolor{green}{\cmark}] Custom Gas Fee Configuration
\end{itemize}
Despite Metamask allowing users to configure custom gas fees, it currently lacks the functionality for setting a custom nonce directly from the wallet interface. The DApp approach, as observed, generates an incorrect nonce, even if the number is registered in the transaction header. This issue has been reported since 2023 by Ariutokintumi \cite{ariutokintumi_BugReceived_2023}.

\subsection{Trust Wallet}
Usability: \textcolor{red}{Cannot be used}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, nolistsep]
	\item [\textcolor{green}{\cmark}] Custom Nonce
	\item [\textcolor{green}{\cmark}] Custom Gas Fee Configuration
\end{itemize}
While Trust Wallet provides the functionality to set a custom nonce and configure gas fees, it cannot be used for our purposes. During testing on the testnet, the configured settings did not reflect accurately. Furthermore, on the mainnet, even when the configuration is displayed correctly, confirming the transaction results in an error message stating \texttt{x is not a valid digit for number system with base 10}. This issue renders Trust Wallet unsuitable for our intended use.
